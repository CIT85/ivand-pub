                                <p>Had an interest in the series prior, but had begun after making an agreement with a
                                    friend
                                    that he play Killer7 if I play this. <br> This trade was not equal, this game is
                                    frighteningly longer.</p>

                            Would be strangely interested in writing about how this game feels a lot like a successor to
                            the
                            Downtown Nekketsu series of games and how that part of them seems to go underappreciated.
