                <h4>Man I Love This Album</h4>

                <h5>WHAT IS THIS</h5>

                <p class="maincn"> 
                    After achieving national success with the releases of <i>"Boys & Girls"</i> and <i>さくらの唄(Sakura no uta)</i>, the band <b>GOING STEADY</b> broke up as they had begun to hit the peak of their popularity. Months after this, on a tribute album for the band <b>Elephant Kashimashi</b>, the band's frontman, Kazunoba Mineta had contributed under a new name, <b class="bold">GING NANG BOYZ.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    2 years later this newly formed band would put out their first <b>two</b> releases, on the same day. While the other album, <i>DOOR</i> is great, the one that's gained my love and that I want to talk about is the other half of this release, <i>君と僕の第三次世界大戦的恋愛革命(You & I's WW III Love Revolution)</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    what a title
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>IM ON A SEVERE TIME CRUNCH SO I NEED TO FAST TRACK THIS PART</h5>
                <p>
                    I had initially found the album through a playlist of japanese punk songs and had taken note of it because of the cover featuring an edit of a picture from the comic <i>"Stop! Hibari-kun"</i>, an interesting piece of history on its own, but this recognition made it catch my interest, and immediately keep it as soon as the first track played, opening with a more gentle singing before immediately switching into off key screaming with a slamming crunchy guitar behind it. Then the second track, <i>SKOOL KILL</i> played, and immediately opened with yelling, in english "CRASH KILL DESTROY CRASH KILL DESTROY" and it just kept me.

                <h5>MAN I WOULD LOVE TO WRITE MORE</h5>
                <p>
                    I could write something about each song in particular but I'm instead going to end off on two things, one I adore the progression of the theme of the songs on the album, starting off with aggressive, vulgar songs about anger and frustration but slowly pushing into more sweet, loving songs, and ending off on the reminiscent track "Somehow we became adults".
                </p>
                <p>I would love to say more but the final thing I have to show about my adoration for this album is that the band had their first US tour this year, and I was not only able to go, but was able to meet Mineta and get my copy of the album signed. OTHER THINGS ALSO HAPPENED BUT THAT'S NOT FOR WRITING HERE</p>
