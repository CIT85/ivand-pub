                    It's common practice among solo developers and small teams to push their games into the public eye
                    through flashy videos and snippets posted to social media sites, br and as such, some time ago, the
                    first big video showing off VA Proxy had appeared, showing off that the game would allow the player
                    the option to time a block to parry and deflect a nuclear blast. Something like this had dropped at
                    a perfect time to get attention, with parrying having already been a beloved mechanic in video games
                    as far back as <i>Street Fighter 3: Third Strike</i>(1999), and gaining further appreciation through
                    the recent wave of nostalgia for action games and games like <i>ULTRAKILL</i>(2020) pushing the
                    limits on what the mechanic could be used for. And as such, the video caused a wave of excitement
                    for what would be remembered regularly as the "parry the nuke game". Through all of this though, I
                    felt uneasy about it. I'd already felt that games were increasing a focus on only parrying too much
                    as it was and more developers trying to push this aspect specifically felt like it couldn't go well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then came a few days ago, when browsing the recent demo releases, I had seen that the developer
                    released a demo of the game. While I had my doubts about it, I decided it was still worth trying and
                    that I still was just judging off a single video, and it wouldn't be fair to judge the game so
                    negatively off a single video.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was only mostly incorrect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The core of the issue I took with the game is the very same that I had felt when seeing the video
                    that put it on the radar, a concern that the game would be so focused on spectacle that depth would
                    be neglected as it wouldn't draw as many eyes, and that's precisely what I had gotten out of it.
                    <br>
                    There are giant enemies, because its COOL to fight giant opponenents! But the enemies in question
                    are fought one at a time, and are so large that their attacks end up overshooting you.
                    <br>
                    The world you play in is huge, because its COOL to have massive expanses you can run across in a
                    game! But the few enemies the game world has are dotted so far apart that you spend more time
                    running than you do actually fighting.
                    <br>
                    There are massive cave structures and labyrinths set up, because its COOL to explore! But there's
                    nothing of interest in them.
                    <br>
                    Several additions that are all admittedly, impressive, and can seem cool whne first seen, but fall
                    apart when actually engaged with, most of all, the combat.
