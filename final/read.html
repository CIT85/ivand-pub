                <h4>I took too long reading The Castle and had to return my library copy. When I searched the Barnes and Noble for a copy to own for myself I instead found a copy of the Trial and decided I may as well read that one.</h4>

                <p class="maincn"> 
                    I mean it's exactly what it says up there. Presently I'm only about 50 pages in so I can't have too many deep thoughts on the book but I do want to talk a little bit about something I've always thought about with Kafka and it's how there's this idea I see regularly that Kafka stories have a dreary, realistic, and bleak tone to them. While this isn't untrue I think a lot of people tend to gloss over how a lot of his stories can at times be <i>funny.</i> Even in his most known story, the Metamorphosis, the fact that Gregor awakens as some kind of pest(the original translation does not specify a bug), his main concern initially is about how he's going to get to work. I think that this is inherently funny on its own. <br>
                    Or how in the castle, at one point, when K is attempting to ask about how his position got mixed up and ended in him getting sent to the castle the story is focused around, he is presented with an incredibly long speech explaining the method in which the mail at the castle works, and a pause is only given to him to ask if he's not bored of the explanation, to which he flatly states that he finds the way that they're managed to completely throw his life off course and have no idea how they did so entertaining. <br>
                    The man then tells him he's not supposed to find it entertaining, and continues his explanation. <br>
                    This in particular is where a lot of the core of the humor comes from, it's a somewhat apathetic humor, where you get put into a bad situation, and there's just no explanation for how, so the most you can do is laugh about how absurd all of it is.
                    <br>
                    There's also a bit I like in the Trial at the beginning where after he's accosted by the police officers, and they order him to his room, his first question is why, when they want to take him in, presumably, they would put him in a room where he had a multitude of ways to kill himself. I think there's an immediate humor to both immediately considering suicide at such a slight provocation, and also to not realizing how out there of a response it is, and assuming it would be obvious to another.
