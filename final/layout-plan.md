## Accessibility
- Alt text on every image used
- titles used whenever possible
- links designed around use of tab key
## Standard I will follow
- I am using the common media query breakpoints.

## Layout changes
- As the site is intentionally very utility first, there's not much that needs to be changed with screen size.
- Side images and section size limits are implemented to let the reader's eyes rest in the center of the screen instead of stretching across it
  - Smaller screen sizes accomplish this automatically, so the images and limits can be removed or lightened
- May have to make landscape images have different limits as to use screen real estate more effectively.
