# Review type blog

I like writing about things I've read, watched, played, or listened to, but while I have made accounts on review sites dedicated to those kinds of things I dislike writing on them because of the limited format and the fact that posting on them means it will be connected to the page for that specific item, making it into more of a public piece than I'd like it to be. Having a site dedicated to this sort of thing would be beneficial to me then, along with the ability to format them more uniquely and not have to stick to it being solely about a particular piece. Making this site would then also be easier for me to do as I already have a lot of pictures and writings stored on my computer of these things and wouldn't need to go out of my way to get any new ones.

About

  - set font family to courier out of preference, set text align to center.
  - felt no need to change others
- set a:hover, focus, and visited to different colors

## Hero Image Design

- I chose this image because its a piece from a comic I like a lot (BLAME!)
- Its set in the CSS to appear on every page. If I were to change it by page I would likely change it in the individual pages' inline CSS
- I chose to place it in the back and leave it in place, as I think any other option like repeating would be ugly or distracting.
