                <h4>What is this site about?</h4>

                <p class="maincn"> 
                    Stuff that I like. Things I've watched played or read, effectively a log of those things for my personal use and to host writing.
                </p>

                <h4>Who is this site for?</h4>

                <p>
                    ME. And anyone who's interested in my ramblings. But ultimately this site is designed to my tastes and for my purposes, outside of accessibility, I don't really consider anyone else part of the audience for this. It's a bit of a vanity project, really.
                </p>
                
                <h4>What inspired me to create this?</h4>

                <p>Needing a grade. As for the inspiration for the actual content, largely the blogs I've enjoyed reading about game design and similar subjects. The first that comes to mind for me now though would be the site run by kayinworks, <a href="https://kayin.moe/">kayin.moe.</a></p>

                <h4>Future add ons?</h4>
                <p>Anything to make it look more to my taste. I want to look more into grid and figure out the intricacies of Sticky more to get a site that moves with the reader, while still remaining readable. I want my paragraphs to be like lily pads floating around in a pond almost. I would love to add weird easter eggs and just for fun pages as well. Tags, better categories, things that would require more planning than I've done now.</p>

                <h4>New tech?</h4>
                <p>I would like to figure out how to use things like spotify embeds and the interactivity afforded by HTML5 to host or create small games that could be played on the site. I want to learn javascript to do things there and create more intricate user forms to submit things like images as well. An automated email would be nice.</p>
