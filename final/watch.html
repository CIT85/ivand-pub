                <h5>Some Context</h5>

                <p class="maincn">
                    El Topo is a film released in 1970, starring and directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky as his second full
                    length directed film, after <i class="whites">"Fando y Lis"</i> 2 years prior.
                    <br>
                    This movie is the first time the phrase "acid western" was used to describe a movie in any formal
                    writing, and watching it makes it clear why even from just the name, with the movie starting with a
                    man and a child burying the portrait of a woman, and venturing into a village littered with dead
                    bodies, and covered in blood. Through all of this, the only context given to the viewer is the
                    events they witness, the gunfighter clad in black seeing a village destroyed, and going off in
                    search of the culprits.
                    <br>
                    This "acid western" aspect to the movie gets stronger as it progresses, with several elements
                    seeming ripped from Western movies but with the context they exist in stripped from them, an endless
                    desert, at most described as a circle, towns within this desert where people live but with seemingly
                    no reason for why they exist where they do, and master gunfighters that exist outside of them, that
                    seemingly exist only to be dispatched by the main character and to provide him with lessons to bring
                    him closer to enlightenment.

                <h5>My viewing</h5>

                <p>
                    For a long time I'd had a passing interest in the work of Alejandro Jodorowsky, having known about
                    him from praise my friends had given to another film of his, <i class="whites">"The Holy
                        Mountain"</i> and his collaboration with the artist Moebius on both the comic <i
                        class="whites">"The Incan"</i> and a cancelled adaption of the <i class="whites">"Dune"</i>
                    novel.
                    <br>
                    My reason for getting to this one first was basically just closer association. A while prior I had
                    been going through several Suda51 games, and had remembered that this movie was cited by him as a
                    primary inspiration for <i class="whites">"No More Heroes"</i>
                    <br>
                    This naturally intrigued me because from the glance I gave the movie at the time I knew it was a
                    surreal western made in Mexico in the 1970s. And No More Heroes felt.
                </p>

                        width="200">

                <p>
                    Very at odds with that.
                    <br>
                    To put it lightly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because of this, my interest was now peaked, and I went and downloaded the movie before promptly
                    forgetting to actually watch it for the next 3 months. A common pattern.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then I finally did watch it! And I enjoyed it!
                    <br>
                    I'm naturally attracted to any sort of psychedelic or surreal theming, and as I had gotten at
                    earlier, this movie has it <i>all over.</i> While stripping away several things that ground aspects
                    of a typical western can initially seem like a negative, it's really more a trimming of the fat
                    surrounding the actual movie's purpose, that being the mental and religious journey of a man seeking
                    enlightenment. In a way it's a very honest portrayal of what a movie actually is, the towns he
                    visits don't serve any purpose beyong offering him motive or a location to have something happen to
                    him, so there's no need to overcomplicate them by giving them more detail, they exist in service of
                    him, as does the world, and the entire movie, really.
                </p>

                <h5>THIS MOVIE IS COOL</h5>

                <p>
                    Anyways I've talked about the parts of the movie that are more meaningful, now for the parts that I just think are <b class="bold"><i>COOL.</i></b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    First off, the setting, I mentioned my love of psychedlic and surreal themes, but this movie also has another thing I love, <b class="bold"><i>GIANT DESERTS</i></b>. The entire movie takes place in one, and around several strange landmarks in said desert, like the first masters tower, the oasis, the cavern that the final act of the movie opens in. It's cool.
                </p>
                <figure class="leftfig">
                    <img src="img/watch/el_topo_fits.png" alt="Several cowboys pointing their guns to the top left of the image." title="El Topo" width="200">
                    <figcaption>
                        <p>El Topo</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                

                <p>Second, the <b class="bold"><i>COSTUME DESIGN</i></b>. Obviously El Topo himself has a really cool one, clad completely in black, but the rest of the characters have really distinctive and cool outfits as well, with the cowboys at the start as an early example. The gunmasters later are also distinctive, in particular I recall the shirtless man with bullet holes, and the one that's actually a man with no legs riding piggyback on a man with no arms.</p>

                <p>Lastly, and one I don't really have images for, is the <b class="bold"><i>DIALOGUE</i></b>. This is one of the places where I do feel the influence Suda51 got from this movie(aside from the plot, since No More Heroes' premise is basically the second act of this movie, but in a different direction). There isn't much dialogue in the movie, but what there is is purposeful and just sounds cool. Lines like "I try not to win, but to achieve the perfect domain." Give information about their characters while holding a very cool <i>feel</i> to them. Tonally, reminds me a lot of the writing in Killer7, as well as some of the less comedic segments of No More Heroes.</p>

                <p>
                    I don't have many closing thoughts for this. I've spent too long on it. I will say that this is a movie that's likely best watched alone, or with a group that will be quiet and pay attention to discuss it later. It's a very dense movie and some scenes may feel a bit odd when near people you know or respect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    lol
